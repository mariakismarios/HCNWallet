# HCN Wallet
An electron-based wallet based on [KristWeb](https://github.com/tmpim/KristWeb), originally developed by [Lemmmy](https://github.com/tmpim).

## Building from source
This wallet used Electron Forge. If a binary for your system isn't provided, you may build it according to the [official documentation](https://www.electronforge.io/). Make sure to import the existing project instead of generating a new one, as that could have unintended consequences.
